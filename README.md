# Snake_water_gun-game
Hi
Myself Abhishek gupta.
This is snake , water and gun game in which computer chooses  random name among snake , water and gun  using random module in python and you
have 10 chances in which several cases are present..
If you win then you will get +1 point and if computer win then computer will also get +1 point & if both chooses same name for eg-("computer 
chooses snake and you will also chooses snake then you both gets 0 point.
at the end after 10 chances you will know who win.
thank you.
